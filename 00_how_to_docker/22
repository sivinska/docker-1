#The MANAGER STATUS column shows node participation in the Raft consensus:
#
#No value indicates a worker node that does not participate in swarm management.
#Leader means the node is the primary manager node that makes all swarm management and orchestration decisions for the swarm.
#Reachable means the node is a manager node participating in the Raft consensus quorum. If the leader node becomes unavailable, the node is eligible for election as the new leader.
#Unavailable means the node is a manager that canâ€™t communicate with other managers. If a manager node becomes unavailable, you should either join a new manager node to the swarm or promote a worker node to be a manager.
