#https://www.diffen.com/difference/TCP_vs_UDP
#There are two types of Internet Protocol (IP) traffic. They are TCP or Transmission Control Protocol and UDP or User Datagram Protocol.
#TCP is connection oriented â€“ once a connection is established, data can be sent bidirectional. 
#UDP is a simpler, connectionless Internet protocol. Multiple messages are sent as packets in chunks using UDP.
